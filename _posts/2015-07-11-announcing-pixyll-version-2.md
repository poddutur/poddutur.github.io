In an effort to make Pixyll easier to customize and more aesthetically pleasing, we've release version `2.0`.
Here is an example I changed this 
<div> 
$$ x_1^2 = 4 $$ 
</div>  

Pixyll now features:

* Line anchors in code blocks and new syntax highlighting
* A customizable variables file
* Modular, and lighter weight CSS
* No more `max-width` media queries
